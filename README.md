# 📊 AI Studio Project: Sentiment Analysis on Book Reviews

## 📌 Project Overview
This project demonstrates sentiment analysis using machine learning on a dataset of book reviews. It is designed to showcase skills in preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and visualization.

## 🎯 Objectives and Goals
- Build and evaluate ML models for sentiment classification.
- Provide interactive Jupyter notebooks for reproducibility.
- Deliver professional documentation suitable for recruiters and collaborators.

## ⚙️ Methodology
- Preprocessing: cleaned and vectorized text data using TF-IDF.
- Modeling: applied Logistic Regression and Neural Networks.
- Evaluation: measured accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
- Visualization: included confusion matrices and performance plots.

## 📊 Results and Key Findings
- Achieved competitive accuracy (>85%) on test data.
- Logistic Regression performed strongly on balanced datasets.
- Neural Networks showed improvement with hyperparameter tuning.

## 📈 Visualizations
Results visualizations can be found in the `results/` directory.

## 🔜 Next Steps
- Expand dataset with additional sources.
- Experiment with deep learning NLP architectures (e.g., LSTMs, Transformers).
- Deploy as a web app for interactive predictions.

## 📂 Dataset
